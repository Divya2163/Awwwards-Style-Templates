## üìù How to Contribute

Lofi Study provides easy customization to the study session. It allows you to have a Pomodoro timer and adjust the timer according to your preferences. There are multiple background themes to choose from which are provided by 24/7 live Lofi videos from videos. When there is no internet connection, instead of videos from YouTube the user will only have an image holder from the same video to have an aesthetic Lofi image. The user can adjust the volume of the music, skip to another video background, and even pause it. The "Get quotes" button  gives quotes from Anime through an API to provide motivation. The study sessions are indicated by a red header and breaks by green.
